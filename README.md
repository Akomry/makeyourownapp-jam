# Make your own app! - Yet Another Collaborative Whiteboard App

## What is it ?
@akomry's submission to `Make your own app!` game jam.

Basically, this is an online drawing app. It only has the most basic tools for now, pen and eraser with custom color, but I hope to be able to add more.


## Dependencies
Probably **[Java 23](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=23)** up and running.


## Installation guide
It will depend on if we manage to generate artifacts using the Maven CI/CD workflows, but you'll probably have to 
install a packaged zipped file. Then execute `[extract dir]/bin/app`.
