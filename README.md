## What is it ?

Probably a networking or multimedia app or something.

You need at least **[Java 23]()** up and running.


## Installation guide
It will depend on if we manage to generate artifacts using the Maven CI/CD workflows, but you'll probably have to 
install a packaged zipped file. Then execute `[extract dir]/bin/app`.
